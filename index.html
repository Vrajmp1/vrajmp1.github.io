        <p><small>TheClassTracker is an independent third-party service and is not affiliated with or associated with the University of South Florida. The app monitors open seats in university courses and sends notifications to users; however, registration must be completed directly through the University’s official system by the student. Since the class registration is managed by the University, there is no guarantee of acquiring a seat in the course.</small></p>
